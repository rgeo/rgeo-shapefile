module RGeo
  module Shapefile
    # Represents a shapefile that is open for reading.
    #
    # You can use this object to read a shapefile straight through,
    # yielding the data in a block; or you can perform random access
    # reads of indexed records.
    #
    # You must close this object after you are done, in order to close
    # the underlying files. Alternatively, you can pass a block to
    # Reader::open, and the reader will be closed automatically for
    # you at the end of the block.
    #
    # === Dependencies
    #
    # Attributes in shapefiles are stored in a ".dbf" (dBASE) format
    # file. The "dbf" gem is required to read these files. If this
    # gem is not installed, shapefile reading will still function,
    # but attributes will not be available.
    #
    # Correct interpretation of the polygon shape type requires some
    # functionality that is available in the RGeo::Geos module. Hence,
    # reading a polygon shapefile will generally fail if that module is
    # not available or the GEOS library is not installed. It is possible
    # to bypass this requirement by relaxing the polygon tests and making
    # some assumptions about the file format. See the documentation for
    # Reader::open for details.
    #
    # === Shapefile support
    #
    # This class supports shapefiles formatted according to the 1998
    # "ESRI Shapefile Technical Description". It converts shapefile
    # data to RGeo geometry objects, as follows:
    #
    # * Shapefile records are represented by the
    #   RGeo::Shapefile::Reader::Record class, which provides the
    #   geometry, the attributes, and the record number (0-based).
    # * Attribute reading is supported by the "dbf" gem, which provides
    #   the proper typecasting for numeric, string, boolean, and
    #   date/time column types. Data in unrecognized column types are
    #   returned as strings.
    # * All shape types documented in the 1998 publication are supported,
    #   including point, polyline, polygon, multipoint, and multipatch,
    #   along with Z and M versions.
    # * Null shapes are translated into nil geometry objects. That is,
    #   Record#geometry will return nil if that record has a null shape.
    # * The point shape type yields Point geometries.
    # * The multipoint shape type yields MultiPoint geometries.
    # * The polyline shape type yields MultiLineString geometries.
    # * The polygon shape type yields MultiPolygon geometries.
    # * The multipatch shape type yields GeometryCollection geometries.
    #   (See below for an explanation of why we do not return a
    #   MultiPolygon.)
    #
    # Some special notes and limitations in our shapefile support:
    #
    # * Our implementation assumes that shapefile data is in a Cartesian
    #   coordinate system when it performs certain computations, such as
    #   directionality of polygon rings. It also ignores the 180 degree
    #   longitude seam, so it may not correctly interpret objects whose
    #   coordinates are in lat/lon space and which span that seam.
    # * The ESRI polygon specification allows interior rings to touch
    #   their exterior ring in a finite number of points. This technically
    #   violates the OGC Polygon definition. However, such a structure
    #   remains a legal OGC MultiPolygon, and it is in principle possible
    #   to detect this case and transform the geometry type accordingly.
    #   We do not yet do this. Therefore, it is possible for a shapefile
    #   with polygon type to yield an illegal geometry.
    # * The ESRI polygon specification clearly specifies the winding order
    #   for inner and outer rings: outer rings are clockwise while inner
    #   rings are counterclockwise. We have heard it reported that there
    #   may be shapefiles out there that do not conform to this spec. Such
    #   shapefiles may not read correctly.
    # * The ESRI multipatch specification includes triangle strips and
    #   triangle fans as ways of constructing polygonal patches. We read
    #   in the aggregate polygonal patches, and do not preserve the
    #   individual triangles.
    # * The ESRI multipatch specification allows separate patch parts to
    #   share common boundaries, thus effectively becoming a single
    #   polygon. It is in principle possible to detect this case and
    #   merge the constituent polygons; however, such a data structure
    #   implies that the intent is for such polygons to remain distinct
    #   objects even though they share a common boundary. Therefore, we
    #   do not attempt to merge such polygons. However, this means it is
    #   possible for a multipatch to violate the OGC MultiPolygon
    #   assertions, which do not allow constituent polygons to share a
    #   common boundary. Therefore, when reading a multipatch, we return
    #   a GeometryCollection instead of a MultiPolygon.

      # Create a new shapefile reader. You must pass the path for the
      # main shapefile (e.g. "path/to/file.shp"). You may also omit the
      # ".shp" extension from the path. All three files that make up the
      # shapefile (".shp", ".shx", and ".dbf") must be present for
      # successful opening of a shapefile.
      #
      # You must also provide a RGeo::Feature::FactoryGenerator. It should
      # understand the configuration options <tt>:has_z_coordinate</tt>
      # and <tt>:has_m_coordinate</tt>. You may also pass a specific
      # RGeo::Feature::Factory, or nil to specify the default Cartesian
      # FactoryGenerator.
      #
      # If you provide a block, the shapefile reader will be yielded to
      # the block, and automatically closed at the end of the block.
      # In this instance, File.open returns the value of the block.
      # If you do not provide a block, the shapefile reader will be
      # returned from this call. It is then the caller's responsibility
      # to close the reader when it is done.
      #
      # Options include:
      #
      # [<tt>:factory_generator</tt>]
      #   A RGeo::Feature::FactoryGenerator that should return a factory
      #   based on the dimension settings in the input. It should
      #   understand the configuration options <tt>:has_z_coordinate</tt>
      #   and <tt>:has_m_coordinate</tt>. You may also pass a specific
      #   RGeo::Feature::Factory. If no factory generator is provided,
      #   the default Cartesian factory generator is used. This option
      #   can also be specified using the <tt>:factory</tt> key.
      # [<tt>:srid</tt>]
      #   If provided, this option is passed to the factory generator.
      #   This is useful because shapefiles do not contain a SRID.
      # [<tt>:assume_inner_follows_outer</tt>]
      #   If set to true, some assumptions are made about ring ordering
      #   in a polygon shapefile. See below for details. Default is false.
      #
      # === Ring ordering in polygon shapefiles
      #
      # The ESRI polygon shape type specifies that the ordering of rings
      # in the shapefile is not significant. That is, rings can be in any
      # order, and inner rings need not necessarily follow the outer ring
      # they are associated with. This specification causes some headache
      # in the process of constructing polygons from a shapefile, because
      # it becomes necessary to run some geometric analysis on the rings
      # that are read in, in order to determine which inner rings should
      # go with which outer rings.
      #
      # RGeo's shapefile reader uses GEOS to perform this analysis.
      # However, this means that if GEOS is not available, the analysis
      # will fail. It also means reading polygons may be slow, especially
      # for polygon records with a large number of parts. Therefore, it
      # is possible to turn off this analysis by setting the
      # <tt>:assume_inner_follows_outer</tt> switch when creating a
      # Reader. This causes the shapefile reader to assume that inner
      # rings always follow their corresponding outer ring in the file.
      # This is probably true for most well-behaved shapefiles out there,
      # but since it is not part of the specification, this shortcutting
      # is not turned on by default. However, if you are running RGeo on
      # a platform without GEOS, you have no choice but to turn on this
      # switch and make this assumption about your input shapefiles.
